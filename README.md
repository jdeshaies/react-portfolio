# React Portfolio

## Description

The purpose of this project is to have a single-page application using React.js to render content dynamically in order to create a portfolio that includes various pages. These pages are "About me" (which is automatically loaded when a user visits the portfolio), "Portfolio" (which links to other sample works), "Contact" (which includes a form for a user to put their name, email, and write a message),  and "Resume" (which shows current front and back end technology skills as well as a downloaded resume). After learning about me, looking through my work, and reading through my resume, if a user has any further questions, they can reach out via the form on the "Contact" page or visit my GitHub, LinkedIn or Facebook profiles via the icons on the bottom of each page.
